(* The M will be instantiated with the M monad or the gtactic monad. In principle,
we could make it part of the B, but then higher order unification will fail. *)
Inductive pattern (M : Type -> Prop) (A : Type) (B : A -> Type) (y : A) : Prop :=
  | pany : M (B y) -> pattern M A B y
  | pbase : forall x : A, (y =m= x ->M (B x)) -> Unification -> pattern M A B y
  | ptele : forall {C:Type}, (forall x : C, pattern M A B y) -> pattern M A B y
  | psort : (Sort -> pattern M A B y) -> pattern M A B y.
