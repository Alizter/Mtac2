 * The ltac interace has two issues, see `plus_n_O` in [Induction.v](tests/sf-4.0/Induction.v#L82):
   1. The order of goals is reversed.
   2. The bullets are broken.
   3. `injectivity` cannot be bind.
 * It would be great if all the commands were accepted by `MProof`,
   and not only `Print` and `Fail`.
